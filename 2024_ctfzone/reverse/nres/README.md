### Description

RÃ©miniscences de DefCon, but there is only one file. What can go wrong? This challenge is giga platform dependent and will work only on the latest Windows 10. (tested on 22H2 Build 19045.4651 and 19045.4717)

You can get the fresh ISO from the Microsoft website (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO)

task.exe

Good luck.
