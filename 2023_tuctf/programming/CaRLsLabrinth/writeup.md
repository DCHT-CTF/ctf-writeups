CaRL has gone and trapped you in his corn maze with a blindfold on. Every time you take a step CaRL throws a banana at you and it is a little annoying. What is more annoying is that when you run off the path into the corn, CaRL throws a handful of tomatos at you and makes you restart at 0! You know there is a fresh apple pie at the end of the maze but can you get there? It's always been your policy to never give up!
