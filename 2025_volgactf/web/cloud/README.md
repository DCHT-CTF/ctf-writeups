## Cloud

### Descriptions

Living in the cloud is quite a thrill,
But not everyone’s allowed, still.
CTF — that’s where it’s at,
Where all the bugs are spotted flat!

IP addresses, ports, and flags,
Know these things and fix the lags!
If you want to be the best,
Break a defense, pass the test!

A secret hides up in the Cloud,
Ready on the server, proud.
CTF — a trail so grand,
Chase it quick, or it’ll slip from hand!

Dreaming of that security fame?
Learn it well and don’t forget the name:
CTF’s a game, it’s true,
And in the Cloud, the defense is you!
